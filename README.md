- 👋 Hi, I’m @Inkrocker a.k.a. Bryan Internoscia.
- 👀 I’m interested in become a Indie Game Developer using C# and Unity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Unity @ gamedevhq.com
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small Indie Game Projects to gain experience as a beginner programmer and develop Art Assets as a Senior Artist.
- 📫 How to reach me is quick and easy by sending me a email at inkrocker@outlook.com

Presently I am working on a small Space Shooter game to get familiar with C# while using my own custom graphics designed specifically for this project.
My goal is to complete a playable version for release on itch.io to allow everyone to play my first solo project.

In the near future I plan to launch a official website to showcase my projects while at the same time dedicating a section for my development process with
screenshots and video playthroughs.
